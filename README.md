# Lyn – Take Over

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
we're rolling deep into your
underground crib
thought I sent a prior notice
card for you
we wanna make this party you
don't want to skip
gonna be a show to remember
Take Over it's time to boogie
down
Make Over nothing's gonna be the
way you might like
(it) was over when you started
with us
you should've thought twice
walked on thin ice
hey game's over
(Hey, it's time to boogie down!
Hey, it's time to boogie down!
Hey, it's time to boogie down!
Hey, it's time to boogie down!)
you actually thought that you
can get away with
skeletons in your closet? don't
think so
we're gonna reveal the truth out
to the public
put your hands up, time to
surrender
Take Over it's time to boogie
down
Make Over nothing's gonna be the
way you might like
(it) was over when you started
with us
you should've thought twice
walked on thin ice
hey game's over
we do not live by your rules
dirty work
your ego has driven you out of
truth
you only played yourself, got no
game
serving you right
say your prayers now
Take Over it's time to boogie
down
Make Over nothing’s gonna be
the way you might like
(it) was over when you started
with us
you should've thought twice
walked on thin ice
hey game's over
Take Over it's time to boogie
down
Make Over nothing's gonna be the
way you might like
(it) was over when you started
with us
you should've thought twice
walked on thin ice
hey game's over
